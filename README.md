# XSS SVG

This repository contains a Proof of Concept (PoC) for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) using an SVG image. The SVG file demonstrates a simple alert triggered by loading the image.

## Overview

The PoC illustrates how an attacker introduce XSS to a web application. The included SVG file (`1.svg`) is designed to be a minimal example for educational purposes and awareness about XSS risks.

## Features

- **SVG Image:** A blue square SVG image that serves as the carrier for the XSS payload.
  
- **XSS Payload:** The SVG file contains an embedded script that triggers an alert on load.

## Usage

1. **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/exploit-development/xss-svg.git
    ```

2. **Upload the SVG file (`1.svg`) to your web server:**
   
After cloning the repository, upload the 1.svg file. This typically works well for profile pictures.
